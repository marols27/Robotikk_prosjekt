# Welcome to ELE306Prosjekt
This is part of a semester project in the course ELE306 at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL), where we made a simulation of a robot for the project. 
This repository contains the files that we used during this project.
The project where colaborated on by 4 fellows, named Martin Repvik Olsb√∏, Fredrik Maudal Falk, Yassin Karimi and Abdalaziz Sabon.

It was stored on github for later use, memorial reasons and for some self promotion.
If you ever get to use the project to something usefull, like learning to simulate a functioning robot, that is great!
Other than that, thanks for checking out our repository and i hope you enjoyed it.
